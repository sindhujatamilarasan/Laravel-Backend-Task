## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- User registration and login using email and password.
- Token-based authentication using Laravel Sanctum.
- Only authenticated users can access product and payment routes.

### 2. Product Management
- Authenticated users can create, update, list, and delete their own products.
- Ownership checks ensure no user can modify another user's products.
- Includes Blade-based UI for product CRUD.

### 3. Payment Initiation Stub
- `POST /payments` API initiates a payment stub.
- Accepts `product_id` and `payment_method`.
- Ensures quantity is available and reduces it inside a DB transaction.
- Designed for future plug-and-play payment method integration.

- In Current implementation i reduced quantity on intiating a payment itself actually after success payment we need to reduce quantity.
